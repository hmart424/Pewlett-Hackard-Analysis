# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of Analysis 

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Also to help our client in preparing for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age. 


## Results

Of the 300,024 employees within the company, 90,398 (30.13%) are eligible for retirement.
Senior Engineer, Senior Staff and Engineer's hold the largest share (23.9%) of employees likely preparing for retirement. 
Only 1549 total employees qualify for mentorship/training for an internal promotion. 

## Summary 

With 63 % of the workforce is either retirment or mentorship eligible, many positions will open up within the next 10-15 years. Taking into consideration the low amount of employees who are eligible for mentorship, Pewlett hackard will face a great deficit once a majority of eligible employees retire. The best way to have successful turnover is to menter the next generation of workers that have more skill in computers/tech.
